        <strong>Getting Ready to Study</strong>
        <p>
            As you wait for your programme to begin, we'd like to ask you to start the New Student Preparation Programme; this is designed to help you prepare for life as an online postgraduate student. This consists of:
        </p>

            <li>
                <strong>LEAP, an online English language skills  assessment. </strong>
                <br />
                <br />
                This will help you evaluate your level of preparedness prior to starting your programme. We will provide you with academic resources based on the LEAP assessment results to produce better prepared, more successful students.
            </li>
        </ol>
