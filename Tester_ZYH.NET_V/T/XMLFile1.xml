            <![CDATA[As you know, we have been interviewing over the last two weeks for the position of Senior Corporate Sales Executive. We have decided to hire Simon Parks for the position. Simon was the outstanding candidate during the recruitment process and he will undoubtedly bring a wealth of knowledge, skill and experience to the company. He will be joining us on Monday morning, so I would like you to make the announcement to the team immediately.

I'll fill you in a bit more on his background. Simon has more than 15 years experience in sales. Like many top salespeople, he started at the bottom selling shoes in a department store before moving from retail into corporate sales. Simon has a proven track record. In his most recent position with a major health insurance provider, Simon was twice awarded Salesperson of the Year, and he had the best sales record in the company for the last three years. In his new role, Simon will be focusing mainly on corporate clients but we hope his experience will also help improve sales practices with our individual customers. Please ensure you give Simon an enthusiastic welcome as we really need to get the team excited about his arrival.]]>
